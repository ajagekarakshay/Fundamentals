    <description> Warning This guide assumes you have experience writing JavaScript and are familiar with TypeScript. Normally on the web, we write layout code using HTML which looks something like the following: &lt;article&gt; &lt;h1&gt;An article header&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some content&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/article&gt; This piece of HTML represents an article with a leading header that says ‚ÄúAn article header‚Äù and a paragraph that contains the text ‚ÄúSome content‚Äù.</description>
